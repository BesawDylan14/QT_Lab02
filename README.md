Flash Card Educational Game

Following the mockup that has been included, create a Flash Card Program.

The game should: 

* create random values to display as labels.
* evaluate the answer in the text box and,
* briefly display either Correct or Incorrect, then
* display a new problem.

The program also needs to track how many corrects and incorrects there are and display a message once a set number of questions have been answered.  A good number would be 20, but for testing, of course, use like, 3.

The final report screen should pop up automatically after all the questions have been answered.
